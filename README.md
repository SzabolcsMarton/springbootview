# Makiburger 
#### Few years ago, I build a page for a fictive Hamburger store for practice and learn.
#### I used NodeJs and MongoDb as backend and Vanilla Javascript on frontend with plain css.
#### In this project I use MySql and Java along with ThymeLeaf instead of Node for backend.
#### I Convert the whole app to OOP.
